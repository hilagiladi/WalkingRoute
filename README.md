# WalkingRoute

Find the shortest walking route between two locations.

WalkingRoute is a web application that helps users find the shortest walking route between two locations. It leverages the Google Maps API to calculate and display the route on an interactive map.

The main goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for planning walking routes, whether for exercise, commuting, or leisure purposes. The application takes into account factors such as distance, terrain, and pedestrian-friendly paths to provide the most efficient walking route.

## Features

- Input two locations and get the shortest walking route between them
- Interactive map with route visualization
- Display of distance and estimated walking time
- Customizable route options (e.g., avoid highways, prefer parks)
- User authentication and personalization (save favorite routes, view past routes)

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: The front-end of the application is built using these web technologies to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
- Google Maps API: The application leverages the Google Maps API to retrieve map data, calculate walking routes, and display them on the map.
- Java: The back-end of the application is written in Java, providing the necessary logic and functionality to handle user requests and communicate with the Google Maps API.
- Maven: The project uses Maven as a build automation tool and dependency management system.
